* perhaps change status code upon successful user creation from 204 to 201
* perhaps change status code upon successful project creation from 200 to 201 (or at least make it consistent with user creation)
* return the created user object upon creation of a user, just like it's done with projects


################

* why is return code on project creation 204?
* users are not added anymore on project creation: Add tests for adding users to projects
* deleting non-existing project: no body containing json error. status code should be error rather than 204

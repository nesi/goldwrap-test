* perhaps change status code upon successful user creation from 204 to 201
* perhaps change status code upon successful project creation from 200 to 201 (or at least make it consistent with user creation)
* return the created user object upon creation of a user, just like it's done with projects
* return error codes on errors rather than nothing
* make body input types more consistent, rather than using a mix of plain text and xml/json

* why is return code on project creation 204?
* users are not added anymore on project creation: Add tests for adding users to projects
* deleting non-existing project: no body containing json error. status code should be error rather than 204 
* why is updating a project done on the /projects path, rather than on /projects/{projectid}
* why is updating a user done on the /users path, rather than on /users/{userid}
* i can't manage accounts via goldwrap. do i need an existing test account to create an allocation?
* the following URLs are hard to test:
  .../allocations[/...]: I can't create an allocation via goldwrap, and relying on an existing allocation seems brittle
  .../organizations[/...]: I can't delete an organization via goldwrap. Constantly adding organizations when running tests pollutes the gold database
  .../machines[/...]: I can't delete a machine via goldwrap. Constantly adding machines when running tests pollutes the gold database
